For example, \"Cassilda's Song\" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:\n\n\nAlong the shore the cloud waves break,\nThe twin suns sink behind the lake,\nThe shadows lengthen\nIn Carcosa.\nStrange is the night where black stars rise,\nAnd strange moons circle through the skies,\nBut stranger still is\nLost Carcosa.\nSongs that the Hyades shall sing,\nWhere flap the tatters of the King,\nMust die unheard in\nDim Carcosa.\nSong of my soul, my voice is dead,\nDie thou, unsung, as tears unshed\nShall dry and die in\nLost Carcosa.\n\n\n\n\nThe short story \"The Mask\" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:\n\n\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.\nStranger: I wear no mask.\nCamilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask!\n\n\n\n\nIt is also stated, in the \"The Repairer of Reputations\", that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, \"Not upon us, oh, king! Not upon us!\".\n\n\nAll of the excerpts come from Act I.\n\n\nThe stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the \"irresistible\" revealed truths.\n\n\nThe very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward\nwith more awful effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in:\n\n\nIf I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act\nI should never have finished it [...]\n (\nThe Repairer of Reputations\n).",

            "text": "The Metalink Protocol\n\n\n\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@ The Metalink Protocol                  @\n@ Musings on a Roadmap for the Metaverse @\n@ by: RenownedPsychohistorian  (2016)    @\n@                                        @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n\n\n\n\nIt is readily apparent to even the most casual of observers that there is a strange transformation occurring in our world.  Sometime in the not-so-distant past, we noticed that the unseen world of cyberspace mattered more to society and the physical world than the meatspace once did.  Before, nuclear weapons were the world\u2019s greatest fear- now, their potential impact pales in comparison with the damage which a large-scale hack could do.  In response, ever greater effort must be put into securing against this eventuality.  The weapons get stronger, the walls get thicker, more intelligence is gathered, and we find ourselves in an arms race of coding, racing to the ultimate defense (a benevolent strong AI), and the ultimate offense, (a malevolent strong AI).\n\n\nOur constant need for bickering and insistence on the creation of advantage in order to progress has contributed to the creation of a social economy to stand in for the monetary economy in which the majority cannot fully participate.  Wallowing in our collective misery, angst, and fear, we have largely offloaded the processes of psychotherapy and entertainment to cyberspatial entities.  By doing this, we have created a market for novelty, delivered in quick shots of dopamine, and we have wired ourselves into it with a number of biofeedback systems.  This may not be immediately clear, but all you need to do to get the gist is look at the structure of novelty sites like Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter:\n\n\n\n\nAllow for rapid creation of content (constant stream of alternatives)\n\n\nAllow for positive and negative feedback (likes, disikes, arguments, praise, etc)\n\n\nTie physical and psychological rewards to positive feedback (x subscribers = fame and fortune)\n\n\nUtilize the feedback to enforce standards, affecting the rewards above (bans, deletion, controversy)\n\n\n\n\nThere exist many examples of how the seemingly worthless and meaningless likes and upvotes we dole out by the thousands each week have had very real consequences reflected in the physical world- people have been driven to suicide, rescued from homelessness, dragged into fame, carried out revolutions (Arab Spring), challenged the Establishment (Trump/Brexit), and changed the world (Wikileaks).  Instead of relying on regular \u201cpsychic meals\u201d of happiness interspersed with periods of neutrality and sadness, as has been the wont of humanity for the greater part of modern history, we have opted for what amounts to a dopamine IV with a digital needle, a predictable stream of uppers to help us ignore the crumbling facade of society.\n\n\nThe amount of the meatspace people living today will experience is miniscule compared to the amount experienced in prior generations.  We have already seen the rise of basement-dwellers/shut-ins/hikkikomori/NEETs throughout the connected world, and their number appears to be growing.  Failed by a system not designed to accommodate them, many have retreated to a world which they understand, and in which they can thrive.  Within the context of the social economy, they create psychological structures designed to mimic fantasy- forming elaborate collectives of social and meta-social networks within which they can operate at an optimal level.  Dissatisfied with the heroes, values, and activities of the \u201creal world,\u201d the hikkikomori seeks out new heroes, values, and activities- the fact that they have few responsibilities allows them more time to find those things that resonate best with them.  Entirely unconsciously, the hikkikomori have become masters of cyberspatial bricolage, crafting spectacular conceptions of reality which rival the greatest creative works known to humankind.\n\n\nI have personally spoken with college freshmen whose intellects exceed those of even the least incompetent professors of philosophy.  In the years spent contemplating and curating their inner life, they have become unwitting monastics, bound by economic and social pressure in ever-increasing numbers to the ancient codes of poverty, chastity, and stability.  When a newcomer passes the trials of initiation, they are rewarded with an outpouring of content, myth, and cant that encourages further engagement and creative contribution.  The horizontal mobility in this space is unmatched, the potential for engagement is unlimited, and the avenues of exploration are limitless- growing at a pace far, far in advance of our ability to examine it.  Currently these webs of experiences, conversations, arguments, philosophies, friendships, ethics, and entertainments are stored within the internet, but the locations lie largely within the minds of their creators, scattered across terabytes of folders and hundreds of far-flung websites.  The next logical step is to provide a service for consolidating and codifying these links, but therein lies a key structural problem.\n\n\nThe big leap that powered the internet revolution was the hyperlink- the ability to create roads between words.  The problem is that hyperlinks only operate in one direction.  Clicking a link discards the previous window of information and moves the focus to a single new page- going back or comparing requires the usage of a back button or largely ineffective systems like linear history or bookmarking, unless the user is utilizing a multi-pane browser or multiple screens, which is often unintuitive.  Utilizing hyperlinks to map the \u201cmetastructural monastery of the mind\u201d which is tended by a given user makes little sense, as in many cases the map of the work within the user\u2019s mind often relies on n-directional links- having a video playing rain sounds in the background while watching Netflix on one monitor and reading poetry on the other, for instance.  To express this as a set of hyperlinks requires far more effort than should be required (3 links, 3 clicks), which is not \u201cpsychoergonomic-\u201d requiring a break in the browsing flow to set up.  Relying on this one-directional organizational structure, especially with the oncoming advent of virtual and augmented reality, is misguided.  This is why the big leap in the alternet revolution will be the metalink- the ability to create roads between contexts.\n\n\nA metalink would consist of a hash of contexts and keys, for example:\n\n\nContext1 = {audio: youtube rain sounds, foreground 1: Netflix, foreground 2: poetry}\n\n\n\n\nWhen clicked, this link would open the desired \u201cdatastreams\u201d in the defined contexts.\n\n\nThe basic layout of a metalink browser would look like this, rendered in a VR/AR space:\n\n\n\n\n...with added support for multiple audio and mic channels. Since the metalink is a hash, the keys can also be metalinks, like:\n\n\nContext2 = {audio: conference call, foreground 1: Context1, foreground 2: spreadsheet}\n\n\n\n\nWhen accessing Context1 as part of Context2, Context1 is treated as a second-order stream, and rendered accordingly, such that context dependencies are ordered from first-encountered to last-encountered.  Context2 would be expanded and rendered as follows:\n\n\n{audio 1: conference call, audio 2: rain sounds, foreground 1-1: Netflix,\nforeground 1-2: poetry, foreground 2: spreadsheet}\n\n\n\n\nOnce the level of nesting exceeds the second order of depth, i.e.:\n\n\nContext3= {audio: podcast, foreground 1: Context2, foreground 2: Twitch livestream},\n\n\n\n\nthen existing datastreams are pushed to the background panes, and audio levels are automatically reduced to compensate, based on their priority within the currently rendered context.  Once the background panes are filled, they then fill inwards in either a quadrant-based (\nsee TeamLab's \nNirvana\n) or hex-based \ntessellation\n.  Users can grab and move streams between panes, updating their session hash accordingly, and can share their session hash, or a subset of their session hash, as a metalink, allowing other users to interact seamlessly with large-scale datastream constructs.  \n\n\n(N.B. the physical components required for this are discussed at some length in \n\"The Metagame Paradox.\"\n.  Readers interested in the software requirements for such a system should peruse \n\"The Sensory Indulgence Tank\"\n).\n\n\nWith such a protocol in place, it would become very easy for users to engage with the complex ideas and thoughtforms of their peers, allowing the hikkikomori to share their body of work with the masses, and re-engaging them as productive members of society, capable of mass-scale collaboration and the integration of diverse input into cogent and meaningful output.\n\n\nBy connecting the marketplace of ideas with the marketplace of creatives and consumers with a low-latency link between thought and actionable data, \u201cjust browsing the internet\u201d becomes a productive activity- the thinkers think, the creatives interpret, the users integrate, and the progress of knowledge is vastly accelerated.  Rather than focusing on ensuring the quality of content, this paradigm shift focuses on focus on the facilitation of growth along an optimal vector, optimizing the quantity and accessibility of content for users to integrate into their bricolage.  Instead of wasting this processing power on repetitive tasks through the \nmechanical turk model\n, with an interface like that described above could be used to facilitate a \"creative turk,\" \nsimilar to Mancom's \"entity crushing\" department in \nZero Theorem\n.\n\n\nConsider: Da Vinci was able to create staggering artworks and revolutionize thought with paper, color, and his own mind.  Imagine what he could have done with the raw experiential input of the human race provided in an interactive, mutable fashion!  \n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the metalink protocol is fully backwards-compatible with the hypertext protocol, as every hyperlink can be expressed as a metalink of\n\n\n{foreground 1: http://}\n\n\n\n\nAs the number of users browsing using the metalink protocol increases, the most useful links will be rapidly added to metalink structures, which will be organized into metalink constructs (i.e. dashboards, or complete contexts, the next step in the evolution of the web page) and integrated into metalink services (i.e. metalink aggregators, the next step in the evolution of social media networks), providing a second means of access to the internet as it is today without requiring existing services to make any changes to ensure compatibility.\n\n\nAt its core, the metalink protocol is essentially a system for rendering and managing massive collections of hyperlinks, but adding additional protocols to handle those links is as simple as adding a wrapper to a metalink, like so:\n\n\n{output: blackandwhitefilter.com/#{Context}},\n\n\n\n\nwhich would send the entire current context to a service which would run it through a black and white filter and re-render it.\n\n\nThis approach allows the metaverse to grow out of the seed of the internet naturally, without requiring users to upgrade to maintain their current level of access.  As VR/AR technology becomes cheaper, demand for access to metabrowsing capabilities will increase, driving a research trend towards psychoergonomics, which has as its goal the reduction of latency between projection (reflection of perception) and integration (psychological reconciliation of the propositions suggested by the perception with the projecting node's \"firmware\" \u00abi.e. perceptions\u00bb).\n\n\nThe fewer cycles that are spent converting input into usable data, (i.e.\n\n\n[x means a and means b, therefore c] =\n CREATE RULE {x:c}\n\n\n\n\nthe faster users can iteratively polish away the suboptimal edges standing between them and \"the zone.\"\n\n\nThe key is to optimize datastream input for cognition /as it is now/, not to optimize for cognition /as it ought to be/.  Optimizing input methods to at or behind the bleeding edge ensures maximum adoption and minimizes cycles wasted on retraining.\n\n\nWith no barrier to workability (i.e. setting up tabs, losing track of sites, browser crashes, two-pane view limits), users have naturally more bandwidth each day to \"innovent.\"  Innovention simultaneously polishes the rough edges that develop in limited memeplexes (i.e. interactions between contexts encountered regularly in a small community, like needing a voicechat client, an overlay, and a game window open to participate in an MMO raid) and directs growth in the macroplex (by way of codifying the supply/demand curve at work behind a particular bundle of services).  Under these conditions, the intellectual marketplace will trend toward productivity and self-regulation as psychoergonomic progresses, as advances in the domain create a self-reinforcing (benign, even healthy) cycle of addiction.  As long as you can pass the economic gravity well of the supply/demand curve (which is to say that you can afford the equipment necessary to interact with the metaverse), the addiction cycle will essentially optimize supply and demand, which in turn will simplify markets, and free up more intellectual bandwidth.\n\n\nIt is perhaps easiest to think of the metaverse as a sort of game, analagous in many ways to an MMO.  However, rather than patching the metaverse to enforce a particular method of play (i.e. establishing and enforcing particular usage methods), the game should be patched to expand the number of possible means of play.  The greater the speed at which novelty is introduced, the greater the speed at which  innovation is produced.  Exacerbating the conflict by defining finite laws over which division occurs not only wastes work, it is a futile endeavor, as not all of the people can be pleased all of the time.  It is far more efficient to design a robust \"interaction engine\" and inject as many interactive elements as possible than injecting select elements and defining them in relation to all other interactive elements. The former results in the same number of interactions as the latter, or\n\n\nx*(interactive elements = e)\n\n\n\n\nwhich is expanded by the existing interactions between the\n\n\nset of all e = [E]\n\n\n\n\nwhich is equivalent to\n\n\ne!\n\n\n\n\nAny patch results in\n\n\nxe+e!\n\n\n\n\ninteractions being generated.  The key is that under a managed process, this requires some nonzero number of\n\n\nmaintenance interactions = m, such that 0\nm\n=xe+e!\n\n\n\n\nWhen injected into an interaction engine, however, m = 0, and because of this, facilitated injection (i.e. maximum interactivity) will always be more efficient than managed injection (maximally-defined interactivity).\n\n\nBy focusing on the design of the underlying structures and systems  to constantly reinforce play \"as it is at time = t\" vs. \"as it ought to be at t+n,\" the burden of work is shifted from the developer to the body of users, responding to their natural exploratory efforts rather than to their reactions to enforced change.  The resulting dynamic is one where the user is part of the game's development, with little to no possibility of developing a cogent metagame sufficiently virulent to compete with the game on an extended basis.  Instead of meta shifts occurring over months, they would occur constantly, but due to their rapid fluctuation, no one meta would dominate for long, and the gameplay focus would switch from applied metagaming (i.e. defensive consolidation to secure a position) to innovative metagaming (i.e. innovention based on extant competing interactions in order to gain a personal advantage).\n\n\nIn short, to step back from the metaphor, allowing users to customize and share their interface as intuitively as possible is far more important than defining an interface.  Content is naturally winnowed and curated through interaction/engagement.  this is already an incredibly fast process (i.e. like and dislike), so rather than enforcing curational standards, deference to actual usage is to be prioritized.  Humans are very good at feeling and doing, but they are terrible at prediction.  By extension, modern users are extremely good at finding workarounds and solving technical challenges through individual and group efforts, and it is reasonable to assume that this behavior would carry over into the future.\n\n\nGiven the sudden rapid increase in the availability of information which a metalink protocol would provide, it is even more reasonable to assume that this behavior would be significantly enhanced.  By paying attention to usage patterns, interested developers and thinkers can easily create enhancements to the protocol to meet the changing needs of users, opening up a path towards the optimal processing of information by the human mind.  As things currently stand, the vast majority of the information on the internet is latent knowledge, rather than tacit/explicit knowledge, and it requires an atypical interface to access, shape, and interact with.  This should ideally be corrected insofar as possible through the continuous integration of useful customizations into the chain of metalinks which would theoretically comprise the metaverse- luckily, due to the underlying structure of the metalink protocol, this is an entirely naturally occurring process, which scales infinitely and is well-adapted to parallel computational optimization.\n\n\nTo conclude, it would appear possible, using existing technology, to create a means for interacting with huge amounts of data in a natural fashion.  Once created, this utility would facilitate a massive acceleration in the ability of the human mind to interact with the universe of information, leading to staggering advances as a species in the areas of entertainment, study, communication, and productivity, at an exceedingly low cost.  Owing to this, it is imperative that such a utility be developed so that the benefits of a psychoergonomic interactive metaverse can be reaped as soon as possible.",

            "text": "@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n@ The Metalink Protocol                  @\n@ Musings on a Roadmap for the Metaverse @\n@ by: RenownedPsychohistorian  (2016)    @\n@                                        @\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@  It is readily apparent to even the most casual of observers that there is a strange transformation occurring in our world.  Sometime in the not-so-distant past, we noticed that the unseen world of cyberspace mattered more to society and the physical world than the meatspace once did.  Before, nuclear weapons were the world\u2019s greatest fear- now, their potential impact pales in comparison with the damage which a large-scale hack could do.  In response, ever greater effort must be put into securing against this eventuality.  The weapons get stronger, the walls get thicker, more intelligence is gathered, and we find ourselves in an arms race of coding, racing to the ultimate defense (a benevolent strong AI), and the ultimate offense, (a malevolent strong AI).  Our constant need for bickering and insistence on the creation of advantage in order to progress has contributed to the creation of a social economy to stand in for the monetary economy in which the majority cannot fully participate.  Wallowing in our collective misery, angst, and fear, we have largely offloaded the processes of psychotherapy and entertainment to cyberspatial entities.  By doing this, we have created a market for novelty, delivered in quick shots of dopamine, and we have wired ourselves into it with a number of biofeedback systems.  This may not be immediately clear, but all you need to do to get the gist is look at the structure of novelty sites like Youtube, Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter:   Allow for rapid creation of content (constant stream of alternatives)  Allow for positive and negative feedback (likes, disikes, arguments, praise, etc)  Tie physical and psychological rewards to positive feedback (x subscribers = fame and fortune)  Utilize the feedback to enforce standards, affecting the rewards above (bans, deletion, controversy)   There exist many examples of how the seemingly worthless and meaningless likes and upvotes we dole out by the thousands each week have had very real consequences reflected in the physical world- people have been driven to suicide, rescued from homelessness, dragged into fame, carried out revolutions (Arab Spring), challenged the Establishment (Trump/Brexit), and changed the world (Wikileaks).  Instead of relying on regular \u201cpsychic meals\u201d of happiness interspersed with periods of neutrality and sadness, as has been the wont of humanity for the greater part of modern history, we have opted for what amounts to a dopamine IV with a digital needle, a predictable stream of uppers to help us ignore the crumbling facade of society.  The amount of the meatspace people living today will experience is miniscule compared to the amount experienced in prior generations.  We have already seen the rise of basement-dwellers/shut-ins/hikkikomori/NEETs throughout the connected world, and their number appears to be growing.  Failed by a system not designed to accommodate them, many have retreated to a world which they understand, and in which they can thrive.  Within the context of the social economy, they create psychological structures designed to mimic fantasy- forming elaborate collectives of social and meta-social networks within which they can operate at an optimal level.  Dissatisfied with the heroes, values, and activities of the \u201creal world,\u201d the hikkikomori seeks out new heroes, values, and activities- the fact that they have few responsibilities allows them more time to find those things that resonate best with them.  Entirely unconsciously, the hikkikomori have become masters of cyberspatial bricolage, crafting spectacular conceptions of reality which rival the greatest creative works known to humankind.  I have personally spoken with college freshmen whose intellects exceed those of even the least incompetent professors of philosophy.  In the years spent contemplating and curating their inner life, they have become unwitting monastics, bound by economic and social pressure in ever-increasing numbers to the ancient codes of poverty, chastity, and stability.  When a newcomer passes the trials of initiation, they are rewarded with an outpouring of content, myth, and cant that encourages further engagement and creative contribution.  The horizontal mobility in this space is unmatched, the potential for engagement is unlimited, and the avenues of exploration are limitless- growing at a pace far, far in advance of our ability to examine it.  Currently these webs of experiences, conversations, arguments, philosophies, friendships, ethics, and entertainments are stored within the internet, but the locations lie largely within the minds of their creators, scattered across terabytes of folders and hundreds of far-flung websites.  The next logical step is to provide a service for consolidating and codifying these links, but therein lies a key structural problem.  The big leap that powered the internet revolution was the hyperlink- the ability to create roads between words.  The problem is that hyperlinks only operate in one direction.  Clicking a link discards the previous window of information and moves the focus to a single new page- going back or comparing requires the usage of a back button or largely ineffective systems like linear history or bookmarking, unless the user is utilizing a multi-pane browser or multiple screens, which is often unintuitive.  Utilizing hyperlinks to map the \u201cmetastructural monastery of the mind\u201d which is tended by a given user makes little sense, as in many cases the map of the work within the user\u2019s mind often relies on n-directional links- having a video playing rain sounds in the background while watching Netflix on one monitor and reading poetry on the other, for instance.  To express this as a set of hyperlinks requires far more effort than should be required (3 links, 3 clicks), which is not \u201cpsychoergonomic-\u201d requiring a break in the browsing flow to set up.  Relying on this one-directional organizational structure, especially with the oncoming advent of virtual and augmented reality, is misguided.  This is why the big leap in the alternet revolution will be the metalink- the ability to create roads between contexts.  A metalink would consist of a hash of contexts and keys, for example:  Context1 = {audio: youtube rain sounds, foreground 1: Netflix, foreground 2: poetry}  When clicked, this link would open the desired \u201cdatastreams\u201d in the defined contexts.  The basic layout of a metalink browser would look like this, rendered in a VR/AR space:   ...with added support for multiple audio and mic channels. Since the metalink is a hash, the keys can also be metalinks, like:  Context2 = {audio: conference call, foreground 1: Context1, foreground 2: spreadsheet}  When accessing Context1 as part of Context2, Context1 is treated as a second-order stream, and rendered accordingly, such that context dependencies are ordered from first-encountered to last-encountered.  Context2 would be expanded and rendered as follows:  {audio 1: conference call, audio 2: rain sounds, foreground 1-1: Netflix,\nforeground 1-2: poetry, foreground 2: spreadsheet}  Once the level of nesting exceeds the second order of depth, i.e.:  Context3= {audio: podcast, foreground 1: Context2, foreground 2: Twitch livestream},  then existing datastreams are pushed to the background panes, and audio levels are automatically reduced to compensate, based on their priority within the currently rendered context.  Once the background panes are filled, they then fill inwards in either a quadrant-based ( see TeamLab's  Nirvana ) or hex-based  tessellation .  Users can grab and move streams between panes, updating their session hash accordingly, and can share their session hash, or a subset of their session hash, as a metalink, allowing other users to interact seamlessly with large-scale datastream constructs.    (N.B. the physical components required for this are discussed at some length in  \"The Metagame Paradox.\" .  Readers interested in the software requirements for such a system should peruse  \"The Sensory Indulgence Tank\" ).  With such a protocol in place, it would become very easy for users to engage with the complex ideas and thoughtforms of their peers, allowing the hikkikomori to share their body of work with the masses, and re-engaging them as productive members of society, capable of mass-scale collaboration and the integration of diverse input into cogent and meaningful output.  By connecting the marketplace of ideas with the marketplace of creatives and consumers with a low-latency link between thought and actionable data, \u201cjust browsing the internet\u201d becomes a productive activity- the thinkers think, the creatives interpret, the users integrate, and the progress of knowledge is vastly accelerated.  Rather than focusing on ensuring the quality of content, this paradigm shift focuses on focus on the facilitation of growth along an optimal vector, optimizing the quantity and accessibility of content for users to integrate into their bricolage.  Instead of wasting this processing power on repetitive tasks through the  mechanical turk model , with an interface like that described above could be used to facilitate a \"creative turk,\"  similar to Mancom's \"entity crushing\" department in  Zero Theorem .  Consider: Da Vinci was able to create staggering artworks and revolutionize thought with paper, color, and his own mind.  Imagine what he could have done with the raw experiential input of the human race provided in an interactive, mutable fashion!    Perhaps most importantly, the metalink protocol is fully backwards-compatible with the hypertext protocol, as every hyperlink can be expressed as a metalink of  {foreground 1: http://}  As the number of users browsing using the metalink protocol increases, the most useful links will be rapidly added to metalink structures, which will be organized into metalink constructs (i.e. dashboards, or complete contexts, the next step in the evolution of the web page) and integrated into metalink services (i.e. metalink aggregators, the next step in the evolution of social media networks), providing a second means of access to the internet as it is today without requiring existing services to make any changes to ensure compatibility.  At its core, the metalink protocol is essentially a system for rendering and managing massive collections of hyperlinks, but adding additional protocols to handle those links is as simple as adding a wrapper to a metalink, like so:  {output: blackandwhitefilter.com/#{Context}},  which would send the entire current context to a service which would run it through a black and white filter and re-render it.  This approach allows the metaverse to grow out of the seed of the internet naturally, without requiring users to upgrade to maintain their current level of access.  As VR/AR technology becomes cheaper, demand for access to metabrowsing capabilities will increase, driving a research trend towards psychoergonomics, which has as its goal the reduction of latency between projection (reflection of perception) and integration (psychological reconciliation of the propositions suggested by the perception with the projecting node's \"firmware\" \u00abi.e. perceptions\u00bb).  The fewer cycles that are spent converting input into usable data, (i.e.  [x means a and means b, therefore c] =  CREATE RULE {x:c}  the faster users can iteratively polish away the suboptimal edges standing between them and \"the zone.\"  The key is to optimize datastream input for cognition /as it is now/, not to optimize for cognition /as it ought to be/.  Optimizing input methods to at or behind the bleeding edge ensures maximum adoption and minimizes cycles wasted on retraining.  With no barrier to workability (i.e. setting up tabs, losing track of sites, browser crashes, two-pane view limits), users have naturally more bandwidth each day to \"innovent.\"  Innovention simultaneously polishes the rough edges that develop in limited memeplexes (i.e. interactions between contexts encountered regularly in a small community, like needing a voicechat client, an overlay, and a game window open to participate in an MMO raid) and directs growth in the macroplex (by way of codifying the supply/demand curve at work behind a particular bundle of services).  Under these conditions, the intellectual marketplace will trend toward productivity and self-regulation as psychoergonomic progresses, as advances in the domain create a self-reinforcing (benign, even healthy) cycle of addiction.  As long as you can pass the economic gravity well of the supply/demand curve (which is to say that you can afford the equipment necessary to interact with the metaverse), the addiction cycle will essentially optimize supply and demand, which in turn will simplify markets, and free up more intellectual bandwidth.  It is perhaps easiest to think of the metaverse as a sort of game, analagous in many ways to an MMO.  However, rather than patching the metaverse to enforce a particular method of play (i.e. establishing and enforcing particular usage methods), the game should be patched to expand the number of possible means of play.  The greater the speed at which novelty is introduced, the greater the speed at which  innovation is produced.  Exacerbating the conflict by defining finite laws over which division occurs not only wastes work, it is a futile endeavor, as not all of the people can be pleased all of the time.  It is far more efficient to design a robust \"interaction engine\" and inject as many interactive elements as possible than injecting select elements and defining them in relation to all other interactive elements. The former results in the same number of interactions as the latter, or  x*(interactive elements = e)  which is expanded by the existing interactions between the  set of all e = [E]  which is equivalent to  e!  Any patch results in  xe+e!  interactions being generated.  The key is that under a managed process, this requires some nonzero number of  maintenance interactions = m, such that 0 m =xe+e!  When injected into an interaction engine, however, m = 0, and because of this, facilitated injection (i.e. maximum interactivity) will always be more efficient than managed injection (maximally-defined interactivity).  By focusing on the design of the underlying structures and systems  to constantly reinforce play \"as it is at time = t\" vs. \"as it ought to be at t+n,\" the burden of work is shifted from the developer to the body of users, responding to their natural exploratory efforts rather than to their reactions to enforced change.

Over the next interlude, I will likely publish further thoughts spawned by my viewing, in no particular order.  As of the time of this writing, I am through episode 4 or 5.\n\n\n[Spoiler Alert]\n\n\nWhile it is my intent to address the contents of Westworld in an academic fashion here, those reading on should be aware that spoilers may occur.\n\n\nThe Labyrinth and the Maze\n\n\nThe premise of Westworld is simple.  In the future of, there is a step beyond Virtual/Augmented reality- there is Alternative Reality.  The game is a wild-west \nLARP\n where the NPCs are played by robots functionally indistinguishable from real people,  in a detailed, immersive physical environment.  For the bargain price of 40k a day, one can take a train into the park and fulfill your wildest fantasies, with no risk of harm.  By all classical definitions, it is Heaven on Earth- the Garden of Eden; Paradise.\n\n\nIn occult circles there exists a concept called \"the Labyrinth,\" which is thought to represent the archetypes of all possible spiritual encounters.  The first five levels are shown below:\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the game begins in the garden- in the case of Westworld, the park is the garden.  Traditionally the garden is the realm of perfection, and the driving force towards the Labyrinth is the temptation of the Enchantress. Notice too, that within Westworld there exists a hint of a deeper game- the game that is played in the mysterious \"Maze.\"\n\n\nWhen visitors arrive at the park, they are met by a woman who gives them their orientation.  This is the Enchantress making a pitch to the occupant of the garden- laying out the rules of a game so stimulating as to rouse them from the ennui which comes from being a god.  Once you have taken the bait, deciding that the game is worth the candle, the Enchantress offers a choice of two doors: \"Blackhat\" or \"Whitehat.\"  By donning the hat, you choose a side, and agree that your side must win.  This choice is a common one: good or evil?  Left hand path, or right hand path?  As presented, there is no grey- what once was perfect is now cut int two pieces, and the player feels they must choose between the path of the Archdemon, or the path of the Archangel.  To choose the path of the Rhinoceros in that moment is not to choose, not to be tempted further, but to bask in the glory of that moment before the choice- to let that be enough, and allow the rest of your days to proceed uncolored by projection from that moment forward.\n\n\nAs soon as you have made your choice, you are on a train...\n\n\nA train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you,\nbut you don't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter, because we'll be together.\n\n\n~Mal, Inception\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is the kicker, my friends.  This is the turn, the offering of the cards- not to the guests of Westworld, but to you.  I am about to lay out some rules for a game, a philosophical game- a weaponized virus for the mind.\n\n\n\n\nThe Metagame\n\n\nIf you catch it, I claim that it will change your perception of reality forever.  I am a philosopher by trade, and so I am aware of the reasonable burdens of evidence that are placed upon discourse of this type.  This being the case, I will do my level best to formulate this hypothesis in a logically valid manner, reliant on current technology and science (coupled with reasonable predictions).\n\n\nThe problem at hand is this:\n\n\nGiven that Westworld is designed to be functionally indistinguishable from the world outside Westworld, would it be possible for someone who visited Westworld to know if they had ever left?\n\n\nThe answer is, quite simply, \"No.\"  The reasoning is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there exists a place X that is functionally indistinguishable from reality and someone enters X, then\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey cannot distinguish X from reality. If they cannot distinguish X from reality, then\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey cannot distinguish reality from X.  Therefore,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey cannot ever be sure that they have left X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the knowledge that I have to hand, it is my belief that the \"Maze\" is a ruleset for the game of Westworld that functions as a means to convince a player of the validity of one reality or the other.  Theoretically a human player who passed through it would become convinced that the park's reality was real, and an android \"host\" who passed through it would become convinced that the reality outside the park was real.\n\n\n\u201cI wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got\nup this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm\nnot the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?'\n\n\n~Discussion between Dolores and Bernard, Westworld, Ep. 3, referencing Lewis Carrol's\n\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of reality remains unchanged, but the player's relationship with reality is transformed from that of a bystander to that of an agent, simply by virtue of their experience.\n\n\nIn short, they can be perfectly certain that they can never know what is real and what isn't, and all value judgements based on those concerns are irrelevant.   It is this state of affairs which fulfills the conditions of the \"Metagame Paradox,\"  in which reality is logically defined entirely by perception, with no conception of fact.\n\n\nWait, What?\n\n\nThe key to understanding the Metagame Paradox, is that in formal logic, the negation of a universal is an existential.  Put simply, this means that if I claim that \"Pink elephants don't exist,\" and you show me a pink elephant, the claim that \"Pink elephants don't exist\" is false.  In this case, the universal which we apply to our world (\nWO\n) is \"A place like Westworld does not exist.\"  Currently, this is true.  However, if we can manage to instantiate a place like Westworld in \nWO\n, we can negate the statement \"A place like Westworld does not exist\" and prove that arguments proceeding from that statement within the context of (\nWO\n) are false.\n\n\nThe key is that the theme of X is irrelevant- yes, Westworld begins in the Wild West, but if the architects can trick you into believing that it is real, then they could feasibly trick you into believing that you had left, and show you everything you would expect to see on the outside.  Once the predicate \"A place like Westworld does not exist\" has been negated, and someone has entered it, it becomes logically impossible to prove that the universe is real, or that anything contained within it is fact.  A person who entered such a place would at a single stroke destroy all meaning, all knowledge, and all rationality.  In this world, Death itself would die.\n\n\nWhy?  Well, once this state of affairs obtained, the occupants of \nWO\n would be able to choose between being the gods of a place indistinguishable from \nWO\n (\nW1\n), tailored to their every fantasy and desire, and remaining in their current role in \nWO\n.  Even better, through the use of suspended animation and close medical attention, the lifespan of a person entering the Westworld of \nWO\n could be expanded a great deal, not to mention made to last longer through the manipulation of \"subjective time.\"\n\n\nThe game of \nWO\n would essentially be \"solved,\" and the occupants of \nWO\n would be faced with that age-old choice:\n\n\nYou can choose a ready guide/\nIn some celestial voice/\nIf you choose not to decide/\nYou still have made a choice/\n\nYou can choose from phantom fears/\nAnd kindness that can kill/\nI will choose a path that's clear/\nI will choose free will\n\n\n-Rush, Freewill\n\n\n\n\nBy creating Westworld, the architects give mankind free will- the free will to move to another part of eternal game, or to be satisfied with what this one has to offer.  Regardless of their choice, the outcome is the same- \"reality\" becomes a concept that refers to the collapse of a wavefunction.  A person staying in \nWO\n cannot be sure that they did not enter a similar place in some long-forgotten W-1, nor can they be sure that those who enter \nW1\n (Westworld) still exist within \nWO\n, or even if someone who died in \nW1\n was dead in \nWO\n.  All possible realities would be made real simultaneously.  In short, the moment someone entered Westworld, reality itself would become analogous to Schr\u00f6edinger's cat- simultaneously real and unreal.\n\n\nSounds suspiciously like the concept of the Tao to me, does this concept of reality as paradox.\n\n\nThe Tao is an experience rather than definition. The imagery used to describe this\npath is one of emptiness and fullness, fluidity, and constant change...the Tao [is\ndescribed] as the allness of the universe, as the true reality of existence beyond the\n\nshadows\n of false appearance, as nothingness, as a synonym for God, as a state of mind\nor being, as a method for leaders to rule invisibly by example, as a paradox of opposites,\nas wisdom through emptiness. It is at once all these things and none of them.\n\n\n~The Tao and Taoism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo How Do We Create It?\n\n\nLet us imagine how a place like Westworld might come to be in \nWO\n.  For this proposition to obtain, you need something capable of providing a total immersion of all five senses: sight, touch, hearing, smell, and taste.  It is my belief that by applying current \nWO\n technology, a \"god machine,\" could be built which would satisfy those conditions.\n\n\nSight:\n\n\nImmersive VR technology is beginning to take off- resolution is currently being focused on as an impact area, so it is reasonable to assume that it will continue to improve, as was the case with televisions and device screens, asymptotically approaching mathematically optimal visual fidelity.  Advancements in the areas of eye-tracking applied to adaptive rendering of visual information would really put this over the top.\n\n\nComponent for the God Machine:\n------------------------------\nPressurized, climate-controlled helmet with full 576 megapixel, 180 degree rendering.  \n\nThe helmet would ideally have enough room for the smell and taste subsystems,\nso that they could be hooked up to dispensing units inside the machine.\n\n\n\n\nTouch:\n\n\nFull-body haptics are on the near horizon.  Focusing development in this area around \"illusory\" feedback, rather than perfect fidelity, would need to occur before the \nWO\n god machine could come to be.  However, should this avenue be pursued, tying into the research surrounding such mind body illusions as described in \n\"The Invisible Hand Illusion: Multisensory Integration Leads to the Embodiment of a Discrete Volume of Empty Space\"\n(J Cogn Neurosci, 2013)\n, would speed the process along immensely.  \n\n\nIt is possible to \"hack\" into the mind's idea of itself, but this process hasn't been perfected through electronic automation yet.

The game is a wild-west  LARP  where the NPCs are played by robots functionally indistinguishable from real people,  in a detailed, immersive physical environment.  For the bargain price of 40k a day, one can take a train into the park and fulfill your wildest fantasies, with no risk of harm.  By all classical definitions, it is Heaven on Earth- the Garden of Eden; Paradise.  In occult circles there exists a concept called \"the Labyrinth,\" which is thought to represent the archetypes of all possible spiritual encounters.  The first five levels are shown below:   Notice that the game begins in the garden- in the case of Westworld, the park is the garden.  Traditionally the garden is the realm of perfection, and the driving force towards the Labyrinth is the temptation of the Enchantress. Notice too, that within Westworld there exists a hint of a deeper game- the game that is played in the mysterious \"Maze.\"  When visitors arrive at the park, they are met by a woman who gives them their orientation.  This is the Enchantress making a pitch to the occupant of the garden- laying out the rules of a game so stimulating as to rouse them from the ennui which comes from being a god.  Once you have taken the bait, deciding that the game is worth the candle, the Enchantress offers a choice of two doors: \"Blackhat\" or \"Whitehat.\"  By donning the hat, you choose a side, and agree that your side must win.  This choice is a common one: good or evil?  Left hand path, or right hand path?  As presented, there is no grey- what once was perfect is now cut int two pieces, and the player feels they must choose between the path of the Archdemon, or the path of the Archangel.  To choose the path of the Rhinoceros in that moment is not to choose, not to be tempted further, but to bask in the glory of that moment before the choice- to let that be enough, and allow the rest of your days to proceed uncolored by projection from that moment forward.  As soon as you have made your choice, you are on a train...  A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you,\nbut you don't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter, because we'll be together. \n\n~Mal, Inception  And this is the kicker, my friends.  This is the turn, the offering of the cards- not to the guests of Westworld, but to you.  I am about to lay out some rules for a game, a philosophical game- a weaponized virus for the mind.",

I am a philosopher by trade, and so I am aware of the reasonable burdens of evidence that are placed upon discourse of this type.  This being the case, I will do my level best to formulate this hypothesis in a logically valid manner, reliant on current technology and science (coupled with reasonable predictions).  The problem at hand is this:  Given that Westworld is designed to be functionally indistinguishable from the world outside Westworld, would it be possible for someone who visited Westworld to know if they had ever left?  The answer is, quite simply, \"No.\"  The reasoning is simple:    If there exists a place X that is functionally indistinguishable from reality and someone enters X, then    They cannot distinguish X from reality. If they cannot distinguish X from reality, then    They cannot distinguish reality from X.  Therefore,    They cannot ever be sure that they have left X.    Based on the knowledge that I have to hand, it is my belief that the \"Maze\" is a ruleset for the game of Westworld that functions as a means to convince a player of the validity of one reality or the other.  Theoretically a human player who passed through it would become convinced that the park's reality was real, and an android \"host\" who passed through it would become convinced that the reality outside the park was real.  \u201cI wonder if I've been changed in the night. Let me think. Was I the same when I got\nup this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm\nnot the same, the next question is 'Who in the world am I?' \n\n~Discussion between Dolores and Bernard, Westworld, Ep. 3, referencing Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland   The nature of reality remains unchanged, but the player's relationship with reality is transformed from that of a bystander to that of an agent, simply by virtue of their experience.  In short, they can be perfectly certain that they can never know what is real and what isn't, and all value judgements based on those concerns are irrelevant.   It is this state of affairs which fulfills the conditions of the \"Metagame Paradox,\"  in which reality is logically defined entirely by perception, with no conception of fact.",

            "text": "The key to understanding the Metagame Paradox, is that in formal logic, the negation of a universal is an existential.  Put simply, this means that if I claim that \"Pink elephants don't exist,\" and you show me a pink elephant, the claim that \"Pink elephants don't exist\" is false.  In this case, the universal which we apply to our world ( WO ) is \"A place like Westworld does not exist.\"  Currently, this is true.  However, if we can manage to instantiate a place like Westworld in  WO , we can negate the statement \"A place like Westworld does not exist\" and prove that arguments proceeding from that statement within the context of ( WO ) are false.  The key is that the theme of X is irrelevant- yes, Westworld begins in the Wild West, but if the architects can trick you into believing that it is real, then they could feasibly trick you into believing that you had left, and show you everything you would expect to see on the outside.  Once the predicate \"A place like Westworld does not exist\" has been negated, and someone has entered it, it becomes logically impossible to prove that the universe is real, or that anything contained within it is fact.  A person who entered such a place would at a single stroke destroy all meaning, all knowledge, and all rationality.  In this world, Death itself would die.  Why?  Well, once this state of affairs obtained, the occupants of  WO  would be able to choose between being the gods of a place indistinguishable from  WO  ( W1 ), tailored to their every fantasy and desire, and remaining in their current role in  WO .  Even better, through the use of suspended animation and close medical attention, the lifespan of a person entering the Westworld of  WO  could be expanded a great deal, not to mention made to last longer through the manipulation of \"subjective time.\"  The game of  WO  would essentially be \"solved,\" and the occupants of  WO  would be faced with that age-old choice:  You can choose a ready guide/\nIn some celestial voice/\nIf you choose not to decide/\nYou still have made a choice/\n\nYou can choose from phantom fears/\nAnd kindness that can kill/\nI will choose a path that's clear/\nI will choose free will \n\n-Rush, Freewill  By creating Westworld, the architects give mankind free will- the free will to move to another part of eternal game, or to be satisfied with what this one has to offer.  Regardless of their choice, the outcome is the same- \"reality\" becomes a concept that refers to the collapse of a wavefunction.  A person staying in  WO  cannot be sure that they did not enter a similar place in some long-forgotten W-1, nor can they be sure that those who enter  W1  (Westworld) still exist within  WO , or even if someone who died in  W1  was dead in  WO .  All possible realities would be made real simultaneously.  In short, the moment someone entered Westworld, reality itself would become analogous to Schr\u00f6edinger's cat- simultaneously real and unreal.  Sounds suspiciously like the concept of the Tao to me, does this concept of reality as paradox.  The Tao is an experience rather than definition. The imagery used to describe this\npath is one of emptiness and fullness, fluidity, and constant change...the Tao [is\ndescribed] as the allness of the universe, as the true reality of existence beyond the shadows  of false appearance, as nothingness, as a synonym for God, as a state of mind\nor being, as a method for leaders to rule invisibly by example, as a paradox of opposites,\nas wisdom through emptiness. It is at once all these things and none of them. \n\n~The Tao and Taoism",
